-- This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
-- Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.
-- Notes: Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
-- To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.

SELECT app_id, ROUND(100.0 *
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) /
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END), 2)  AS ctr_rate
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
