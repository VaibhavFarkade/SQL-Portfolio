# SQL-Portfolio

I'm an Aspiring Data Analyst and this repository showcases my SQL abilities. From SELECT statements to JOINs, I've included examples of some of the SQL queries I've worked with. You'll see examples of aggregations, filtering, and data manipulation. The included projects demonstrate my ability to handle and analyze data, and extract meaningful insights from it. These projects give you a taste of my SQL skills and my passion for working with data ðŸ’» 

This repository contains the following projects:->
